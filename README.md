# odin-recipes
We'll be creating a basic recipe website. This website build will showcase my ability in using HTML. Concepts such as using Italics, Bolding, hyperlinking, listing, etc. will be used in the HTML markdown code. Additionally, since this is the first repository I create, it showcases my ability to manipulate files using the Terminal and using Git comfortably.

In the website we will add a few recipes, but exclude the styling, as I want to solely focus on building using HTML. CSS will be showcased in another project.

Enjoy!
