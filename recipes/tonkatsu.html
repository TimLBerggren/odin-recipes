    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p><strong>Tonkatsu</strong> is a beloved japanese dish featuring tender pork loin or fillet, breaded and deep-fried to crunchy perfection. Its name, derived from "<em>ton</em>" meaning pork and "<em>katsu</em>" from "<em>katsuretsu</em>" meaning cutlet, reflects its essence. The dish has a rich history, originating from the adaptation of Western cuisine in Japan during the late 19th century.</p>
    <p>What sets Tonkatsu apart from the other cutlets is its unique preperation. Instead of traditional breadcrumbs, it utilizes <em>panko</em>, Japanese-style breadscrumbs that result in a lighter and crispier coating. Deep-frying ensure a crunchy exterior while maintaining a juicy interior, distinguishing it from pan-fried alternatives. A defining feature is the tangy Tonkatsu sauce drizzled atop the cutlet, adding a sweet and savory dimension. Additionally, it's traditionally served with a mound of freshly shredded cabbage, offering a refreshing contrast to the rich flavors.</p>
    <p>Tonkatsu embodies the perfect harmony of textures and flavors, making it a staple in Japanese cuisine enjoyed by many for over a century.</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Pork – There are two cuts of meat we typically use for this dish: pork loin (ロース rōsu) or tenderloin/fillet (ヒレ hire). Both cuts are fairly lean, but pork loin has a layer of fat that gives the Tonkatsu an extra tender bite when cooked properly. (As with most recipes, the quality of the meat makes all the difference.)</li> 
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Panko – Please get a Japanese brand of panko as non-Japanese brand of panko seem a bit different.</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Neutral flavored oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>Tonkatsu sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    </ul></p>
